# Commits + pushes CHECKPOINT_PATHS (default "logs" — i.e. logs/decisions.jsonl,
# this bot's journal) so trade history survives Render's ephemeral disk across
# redeploys. Safe to call repeatedly, including from a burst of trades:
#
# - logs/decisions.jsonl is append-only, so .gitattributes marks it
#   `merge=union` — git's built-in union merge driver keeps every unique
#   line from both sides on conflict instead of picking one side and
#   discarding the other's newly-appended records.
# - Any other file under CHECKPOINT_PATHS is treated with -X ours on
#   conflict, i.e. "the freshest local version wins" — fine for anything
#   that's a recomputed snapshot rather than an append-only log.
#
# Exits 0 on genuine no-op (nothing to commit) or when GITHUB_REPO/
# GITHUB_TOKEN aren't set (opt-in feature, silent no-op without keys).
# Non-zero + stderr on any real failure; checkpoint.ts captures both and
# never treats a failure as fatal to the caller.
