// Order placement that survives an 18-decimal venue.
//
// The unified `exchange.createOrder` converts a human price with
// `parseUnits(price.toFixed(decimals), decimals)`. At 18 decimals that exposes
// the float's binary representation: `(0.05).toFixed(18)` is
// "0.050000000000000003", three wei off the tick grid, and the pool rejects it
// with `InvalidPrice`. Measured on mainnet: of fifteen ordinary probabilities
// only 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 survive — the ones binary floating point represents
// exactly. A 6-decimal venue never shows this, which is why testnet is clean
// and mainnet is not.
//
// So we never hand a float to the SDK. Prices and sizes are converted in TICK
// and LOT units — small integers, where a single `Math.round` absorbs the
// epsilon — and sent through the raw trader tier as exact bigints. The same
// path the app itself uses.
//
// This module also folds in two things every caller was repeating: a reverted
// write does not throw (check the receipt), and orders must carry an expiry
// capped at the market's own.
