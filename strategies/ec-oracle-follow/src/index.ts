// oracle-follow — a directional TAKER for DreamDEX event contracts. It forms a
// view on where BTC/ETH is heading, then crosses the book only when the market
// is offering the favoured leg cheaper than that view says it's worth.
//
// It follows the ec-starter taker skeleton; the new part is a signal step
// (read the underlying price feed, turn it into a probability) and an edge gate
// in front of the cross. Three things are worth understanding before you edit it:
//
//   • A bearish view is BUY_NO, never SELL_YES. A sell escrows the token being
//     sold, so a naked short is impossible here. Because the bot only ever
//     buys, it needs no mint-a-pair inventory seeding at all.
//   • The DIRECTION comes from the UNDERLYING price, never from the book. Taking
//     a view off the book you're about to cross is circular — you'd be chasing
//     your own target. See signal.ts.
//   • The LEVEL comes from the contract when it can be read (strike or opening
//     price), and from the market mid plus a momentum tilt when it cannot.
//     See signal.ts and the README.
//
// It opens positions and stops there — redeeming winners after settlement is
// ec-settlement's job.
//
// DRY_RUN=true (default) logs the takes it would make and never opens a signer.
// Set DRY_RUN=false + a funded PRIVATE_KEY to trade for real.
//
//   npm start -w ec-oracle-follow
